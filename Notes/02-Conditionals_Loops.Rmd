# Conditionals and Loops

---

## Setup

**1. Download data.**

We will be using a dataset containing citation and alternative metrics for articles published in the PLOS family of journals between 2003 and 2010. The data set was compiled by Priem et al 2012 ([publication](http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4745)). 

Download the data onto your computer from [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/up38z3fd4llanrb/counts-raw.txt?dl=0) dropbox link and move it into a directory on your computer that makes sense.

**2. Read in data into R.**

```{r}
counts <- read.delim("data/counts-raw.txt")
```

## Conditional statements

Decision making is an important part of programming. This can be achieved in R programming using conditional statements such as `if` and `if...else`.

### if {-}

The syntax of an <b>if</b> statement is:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (test_expression) {
  do_this
}
```
```{r}
x <- 5
if (x > 0) {
  print("positive number")
}
```

### if...else {-}

The syntax of an <b>if...else</b> statement is:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (test_expression) {
  do_this
} else {
    do_that
}
```

The else part is optional and is only evaluated if test_expression is FALSE. It is important that the `else` word be in the same line as the closing brace of the `if` statement.

```  {r}
x <- 1
if (x > 0){
  print("positive number")
} else {
    print("negative number")
}
```

### Nested if...else statements {-}

You can have more than two test expressions:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (test_expression1) {
  statement1
} else if (test_expression2) {
    statement2
} else {
      statement4
}
```
```{r}
x <- 0
if (x < 0) {
   print("negative number")
} else if (x > 0) {
   print("positive number")
} else {
   print("zero")
}
```

---

### EXERCISE 2.1 {-}

Write a simple if...else statement to check if 5 is an odd number and if it is print "I am odd", otherwise print "I am even".

---

<!-- Solution -->
<!-- x <- 5 -->
<!-- if ((x %% 2) != 0) { -->
<!--   print("I am odd") -->
<!-- } else { -->
<!--   print("I am even") -->
<!-- } -->

## Loops

Conceptually, a loop is a way to repeat a sequence of instructions under certain conditions. They allow you to automate parts of your code that are in need of repetition.

### `for` loop {-}

The easiest and most frequently used loop in R is a <b>for</b> loop. Here is a demonstration of using loops.

![](img/r-for-loop.jpg)

```{r}
year <- c(2015,2016,2017,2018)
for(i in 1:length(year)) {
  print(year[i])
}
for(i in 1:length(year)) {
  print(paste0("the year is ",year[i]))
}
```

### `while` loop {-}

In contrast to a **for** lop, **while** loops are used to loop until a specific conditional statement is no longer true. 

![](img/r-while-loop.jpg)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
while (test_expression) {
  do_this
}
```
```{r}
i <- 1
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

### EXERCISE 2.2 {-}

**Challenging.** From the PLOS journal publication data we read into R above, here is a plot showing the impact factor according to the F1000 (Faculty of 1000) versus the number of times the PDF was downloaded. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(counts, aes(f1000Factor, pdfDownloadsCount)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, size = 2, width = 0.2) + theme_bw()
```

Using this dataset, write a `for` loop containing an `if...else` statement to change the f1000Factor column into categorical variable with two levels: high impact and low impact.

Do this by translating the following sentence into R code: for every element in the f1000Factor variable, if the value is greater than zero, change it to "high_impact", otherwise, change it to "low_impact".

**Bonus.** Create a box plot (like the one below) showing the number of PDF downloads for high versus low impact articles.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

counts2 <- counts
for (i in 1:length(counts2$f1000Factor)){
	if (counts2$f1000Factor[i] > 0) {
		counts2$f1000Factor[i] <- "high_impact"
	} else {
		counts2$f1000Factor[i] <- "low_impact"
	}
}

ggplot(counts2, aes(f1000Factor, pdfDownloadsCount + 0.1, fill = f1000Factor)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()	+ scale_y_log10() + ylab("log10(PDF Downloads + 0.1)")
```
