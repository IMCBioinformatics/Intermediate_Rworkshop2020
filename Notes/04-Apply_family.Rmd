It’s easier to see the intent of your code, because your eyes are drawn to what’s different, not what stays the same.

It’s easier to respond to changes in requirements. As your needs change, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than remembering to change every place that you copied-and-pasted the code.

You’re likely to have fewer bugs because each line of code is used in more places.
