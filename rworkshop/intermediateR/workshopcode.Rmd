## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

ps<-psmelt
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Testing what eval does

```{r}
pressure=cars
```

```{r evaluate,ref.label='pressure',fig.width=15}

```


```{r chunk2,ref.label='pressure',fig.width=15}

```

```{r sum}
sum=1+1

x=1
if(x >0){
print(x)
}

if(x>0) print(x)
```
